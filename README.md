# PCOS-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
A deep learning-based system to detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome from ultrasound images using VGG16 for feature extraction and XGBoost for classification, achieving 95.74% accuracy.
## Features
- Image classification into **PCOS** and **Non-PCOS**.
- Preprocessing, enhancement, and augmentation of ultrasound images.
- Feature extraction using **VGG16** pretrained on ImageNet.
- Compared Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and XGBoost models.
- Developed UI using **Streamlit** (Flask version also available).
